# Enterprise Security Overview

## Built for Trust. Engineered for Compliance.

We understand that your data is your most valuable asset. That is why security is not a feature we added—it is the foundation we built upon. Our platform utilizes a modern, zero-trust architecture designed to meet the rigorous standards of enterprise IT and compliance frameworks like SOC 2.

### 🛡️ Uncompromising Protection

*   **Bank-Grade Authentication**: We enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP). No reliance on insecure SMS.
*   **Complete Data Isolation**: Your data is yours alone. Our multi-tenant architecture uses strict database-level segregation to ensure that your data remains invisible and inaccessible to any other tenant.
*   **Zero-Trust Session Management**: We use short-lived, encrypted access tokens. If a device is lost or an employee leaves, access can be revoked universally and instantly.

### 👁️ Complete Visibility & Control

*   **Granular Access Controls**: Define exactly who can see and do what. Our Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to enforce the principle of Least Privilege with precision.
*   **Immutable Audit Logs**: Every critical action—from logins to data exports—is permanently recorded. You will always know **who** did **what**, and **when**.
*   **Admin-Assisted Recovery**: Secure processes allow verified administrators to help users recover access without compromising account security.

### ✅ Compliance Ready

Our architecture maps directly to core security principles required by **SOC 2**, **GDPR**, and **ISO 27001**:
*   **Logical Access Control**: Enforced via RBAC and MFA.
*   **System Operations**: Monitored via health checks and comprehensive logging.
*   **Change Management**: detailed audit trails for all configuration changes.
